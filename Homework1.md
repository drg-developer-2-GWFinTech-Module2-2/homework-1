# Acorns: A Modern FinTech Company for Millenials

## Business Overview

Acorns is a financial services and technology company that provides a platform which integrates spending and investing.

Privately held, Acorns was founded in 2012 by the father-and-son pair Walter Cruttenden III and Jeffrey Cruttenden [^1]. Jeff claims to have come up with the idea when he realized that relatively few of his peers had investment accounts. The reasons identified for the lack of investment accounts include high initial balance requirements and the large impact of commission fees on small accounts.

Acorns garnered a great deal of attention during its funding phases and was able to grow at a rapid pace. The high-profile asset management firm BlackRock, Inc. made a substantial investment into Acorns. Additional private investors include several high net worth individuals as well as the company Paypal [^2].

Initial investments totalled $32 million in 2015, and Acorns managed 650,000 user accounts. At least one further investment round in 2019 collected $105 million in additional funding from NBCUniversal, Comcast Venture, and additional investment firms. In 2019 Acorns managed in excess of $1.2 billion in assets across 4.5 million user accounts [^3] [^4].

The company structure of Acorns consists of the following two components:

- **Acorns Securities, LLC**: SEC registered broker-dealer and member FINRA

- **Acorns Advisers, LLC**: SEC Registered Investment Advisor

A substantial revenue component comes from a monthly service fee. Acorns charges $1 for accounts below $5k, and a 0.25% annual fee for accounts greater than $5k.

## Business Activities

A large fraction Acorns users are millenials, with 75% of users under the age of 35. The main problem that the company attempts to solve with the use of its investing services and connected debit card technology is the high barriers for entry that millenials percieve in relation to conventional investment accounts.

An auxiliary problem also facing millenials is poor spending and savings habits. By providing access to the saving and investing capabilities at the time of purchase, Acorns debit card usage has the ability to influence the spending behavior of users.

Acorns provides the following core services:

- Spending
- Investing

Within these categories several more specific services are provided.

### Spending

After funding an account using either a direct deposit from an employer or wire transfer from a bank, Acorns provides users with a debit card that links to the cash account held with the company. This debit card behaves like a standard card, enabling point-of-sale purchases to be completed securely.

However, the Acorns debit card provides a feature called "roundups" which consists of a mechanism to compute an additional fee at the time of purchased. This fee is charged to the user, and is automatically directed to the user's investment account. This enables and encourages direct funding of investment positions at the time of purchase.

Utilizing the Acorns debit card also enables access to exclusive deals made possible through a partnership program called Found Money, which the company has with various retailers. This program encourages users to buy specific products from the external vendors in exchange for a commitment from the vendor to give a small bonus to the user's investment account.

The Acorns platform is available through both a web and mobile platform.

### Investing

Once funds are transferred into the investment account, either through a direct transfer or with the use of round-ups, Acorns provides automated investment management services - sometimes referred to as "robo-advising." Users are able to select a risk tolerance and investment timeline for their porfolio, which can be configured through the app and website. These investment services are available in both individual and retirement account options.

Providing access to the investing capabilities with easy-to-use controls reduces the barriers to entry for new investors. Additionally, by directing round-ups to the investment account, users are incentivised to save at the time of purchase. Being shown their savings potential during the purchasing process encourages users to question whether or not the purchases they are making are necessary and align with their long term investing objectives. Additionally, saving is intrinsically linked to the purchasing process which naturally encourages a higher savings rate by artificially inflating prices (for the benefit of the user).

In addition to automated investing, investing and financial education are provided to the user. Part of Acorns' value proposition is that it provides an all-inclusive financial service and advising service to new investors with small accounts. The target audience are millenials and younger, many of whom have little or no background investing in securities. To combat this and attract new users, Acorns employs investment advisors who deliver regular blog-style informational articles to explain basic investing concepts and strategies.

## Business Landscape

Acorns operates at the intersection of several sectors within the financial services industry. Payment systems, broker-dealer, investment advising, automated investing ("robo-advising"), and spending rewards program services are all provided. This positions Acorns to uniquely capture business related to all related services, and present itself as a "one-stop-shop" for customers needing a place to get started investing with small accounts.

Several trends have presented in the past decade in each of these industries. Acorns appears to have designed the next iteration of many aspects of each trend, rolled up into one unified service offering.

- **Accessibility:** Connectivity has consistently increased and is wider reaching than ever before. More and more potential customers have access to mobile computing devices, giving them more access to services that companies across all sectors within the financial services industry can leverage.

- **Automation:** Technological advances in computing reliability and accessibility, coupled with increasingly wide-reaching connectivity, has enabled many procedures to be automated. Examples include faster peer-to-peer fund transfers and automated decision making based on desired investing guidelines - also referred to as "robo advising."

- **Demand Increases:** With the enhanced technological capabilities, users have increased their expectations of performance and accessibility of finanical services. Additional services and features are also in ever-increasing demand.

Competitors in the respective industry sectors include the following. It should be noted that many of these competitors offer more sophisticated solutions in their respective specializations, but Acorns is the only company which offers all of these associated capabilities.

- **Payment systems:** Paypal, standard debit card and banking service providers (Wells Fargo, Bank of America, etc.)

- **Broker-dealer:** Modern investing and trading brokers (Robinhood, Weull), standard investing and trading brokers (Fidelity, Merrill Lynch, TD Ameritrade, E-Trade, etc.)

- **Robo-advising:** Betterment, Wealthfront, etc.

- **Spending rewards program:** Ebates, Dosh, standard credit card rewards providers (Visa, American Express, Capital One, Citi, Chase, etc.), retailer credit card rewards providers.

## Results

The business impact of Acorns has been tremendous. In its own rite the company has seen explosive growth and widespread adoption. Customers have a choice between this and other similar service providers, but Acorns appears to be the only solution available to small account holders which offers all related services. This has arguably led to its competitors working to provide more and more of the services that Acorns offers.

The return on investment for customers has proven to be on par with that of major mutual funds and related investment vehicles [^5]. Key metrics which also apply to conventional investment management companies include return on investment (ROI), service and trading fees. All metrics compare favorably with conventional providers.

Impact to customer accounts can be interpreted to be substantial, especially when it is recognized that the majority of users are small account holders that otherwise would not be investing.

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

### Recommendation 1: Become an Integrator

One key recommendation that Acorns could benefit from is to change their approach to setting up service and technology provisions to leverage the capabilities of proven companies that have specialties in the required areas. For example instead of providing brokerage services, an existing brokerage such as Fidelity or Vanguard could be utilized. Such an approach would re-position Acorns to specialize as an integrator, which seems to be the primary component missing from all competitors in the entire financial industry (with regards to the packaged services format provided to current customers).

The main benefit to this approach is that Acorns could re-direct its resources and expertise into focusing on the needs of the customer, and facilitating a persistent and efficiently-integrated connection between that customer and the existing solution which would be provided by a third party. Such an arrangement could be expected to greatly increase efficiency and effectiveness of operation, since the service providers have proven experience to draw upon to ensure maximum efficacy.

A notable exception to this rule would be for any external services which are deficient in areas that users require. For example if the payment systems available from an outsourced provider are unable to be efficiently connected to the user's investment account, or if an agreement cannot be reached on a sufficiently low fee structure which supports the value proposition from the customer's perspective, then an in-house solution would make sense.

A secondary benefit to focusing the company on integration efforts and offloading the overhead of providing various services is that more resources are available to be directed at onboarding additional services. Several such additional services are recommended for integration in the next section.

### Recommendation 2: Additional Service & Technology Recommendations

In addition to the services currently offered by Acorns, the following services are in high demand by potential customers (as demonstrated by the usage of external providers of these services) and are suggested for integration into the Acorns service offering:

- **P2P transfer:** Currently a number of services exist to enable users to send money to other users, including those who have no relationship with the service provider. Instant electronic cash transfer as provided by Zelle and related companies has become a valuable capability that many users of these services rely on.

- **P2P lending:** Platforms such as Prosper and LendingTree enable users to make small investments into consumer debt. The accessibility of loans offered by these services is greater than those offered by banks due to less stringent screening requirements. This provides a market for small, moderate-to-high-risk loans that otherwise would not be funded. This unique investing opportunity is an excellent opportunity to enhance diversification for Acorns customers with low account values.

- **Currency conversion:** Currently when sending money overseas or during travel, customers are required to find services which can convert between their native and foreign currencies. Acorns could offer this service to ease transition for customers who have consistent need to convert foreign currency; additionally this exposes foreign currency investing as an alternative investment mechanism.

- **Cryptocurrency investing:** Cryptocurrency has grown rapidly to become a highly regarded investing mechanism. Several services and applications exist on the market to expose cryptocurrency trading to consumers, and Acorns could adopt this as an additional diversification option for user portfolios.

- **More in-depth securities information:** Although Acorns is a registered broker-dealer, in-depth financial information is not easily accessible for the specific funds and securities that are included in the automated investing process. Beneficial upgrades to the process could include user-supplied selections which preferentially scale investements into specific securities that the user has performed extensive research on.

- **Forex investing vehicles:** Currently, investors are required to open a brokerage account at a standard firm to invest in foreign markets. Several mechanisms exist to expose foreign securities and market conditions, and the suggestion is to integrate these more transparently into the investment options.

Additionally, the following novel ideas are suggested to add value to the user "spend-connected-investing" experience:

- **External brokerage account connection:** One half of the technological mechanisms offered by Acorns could be understood to be the round-up feature; the other half is the robo-advising capability. The connection from money collected through round-ups is currently limited to the internally provided investment accounts. One powerful improvement to this arrangement could be to allow users to specify the use of an existing external brokerage account, effectively allowing the round-up feature to be utilized in a wider array of investing contexts. For many potential customers this could raise the value proposition of the Acorns service offering.

- **Market timing information and investing:** One critical aspect of long-term investing that is acknowledged by advisors and brokerages, but for which no solution is explicitly provided, is temporally contextual asset performance. A variety of situations can cause performance fluctuations in an asset category, and while these are predictable in many cases and unofficially recognized, they are neither presented using an official mechanism, nor handled in any automated fashion.
    - Market timing data presentation: Across asset classes there are many contexts which lead to price fluctuations. Examples include interest rate changes having an impact on bond performance; decreased consumer interest in a product class or industry leading to reduced interest in stocks in this space; and cyclically-occurring weather variations which impact produce and other commodity production and sales. Key metrics and plots which provide contextual information to the investor could enable investing activities to be timed with more efficiency.
    - Automated trading using supplemental market timing data: In addition to presenting key market timing data to the user, this information could be used in an automated investing portfolio to enhance returns. For example commodities or commidities proxy funds could be avoided during certain times of the year and purchased during others. Also convexivity in the bond yield curve could be leveraged to enhance returns from bond-based investing funds or direct bond purchaes.
